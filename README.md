# TypeScript Learning Project

This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning **TypeScript**, a powerful, strongly-typed superset of JavaScript. This project includes examples, exercises, and mini-projects to help me understand and apply TypeScript concepts effectively.

## Why TypeScript?

TypeScript enhances JavaScript by adding static typing, which:
- Helps catch errors at compile time.
- Makes code more predictable and easier to debug.
- Improves IDE support with better autocompletion and refactoring tools.

  - Types, Interfaces, and Enums.

  - Classes and Access Modifiers.
- **Advanced Features**:

  - Modules and Namespaces.
- **Hands-On Practice**:
